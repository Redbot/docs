# AutoBank
<!--desc-start-->
AutoBank adds a context menu to the AutoBank button in EQ's bank window. It allows you to automatically remove or add items to the bank with Tradeskill, Collectible, or Quest tags on it. 
Additionally, in the case of tradeskill items you can filter if you should or shouldn't move items with skill mods (Trophies). 
More feature to be considered/added in the future.
