# /mapshow

## Syntax

```eqcommand
/mapshow [<spawnsearch> | reset | repeat] 
```

## Description

This will show spawns on the map, using [Spawn search](../../../reference/general/spawn-search.md). Shown spawns are in effect until you reset /mapshow, or the mapped spawns are regenerated (such as changing certain map filters). Repeat will save the state and apply it to future sessions.
