# Chat

This plugin directs MQ output to your main EQ chat window. 

!!! warning "MQ Output in Reports"
    Be careful if doing a /report or /petition because MQ output will be visible in the /report lines that you send. 

By default, MQ output is set to go to a custom MQ window, handled by the [ChatWnd](../chatwnd/README.md) plugin.
