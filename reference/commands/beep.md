# /beep

## Syntax
<!--cmd-syntax-start-->
```eqcommand
/beep [ <filename> ]
```
<!--cmd-syntax-end-->

## Description
<!--cmd-desc-start-->
Invokes a system beep (beep from the built-in PC speaker).

Adding _filename_ will play a .wav file located in your Everquest directory. This function uses the In-game sound so while a normal /beep will sound if you have EQ muted, this will not.

If you prefer you can play the sounds in the Everquest "sounds" directory by using something like

/beep sounds/_filename_
<!--cmd-desc-end-->
