# /whotarget

## Syntax

**/whotarget**

## Description

MQ enhances this EQ command by allowing you to use it on any target (including NPCs). Output is the same as the [/who](who.md) command (set by [/whofilter](whofilter.md)), displaying the target's class, race, level, guild, con color, and distance regardless of the player being in anonymous or roleplaying mode.
