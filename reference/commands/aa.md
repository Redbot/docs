## Examples

|  |  |
| :--- | :--- |
| **/aa list all** | Lists all AA abilities available to you (doesn't mean you have them) in format [ID : name] |
| **/aa list timers** | Lists just the AA you have that have timers |
| **/aa info** _**abilityname**_ | Gives information about a particular AA ability |
| **/aa act** _**abilityname**_ | Works like "/alt act \#\#", but takes the name instead of \#\# (note: You will notice a fraction of a second delay using this method vs. the /alt act \#\# method). |
