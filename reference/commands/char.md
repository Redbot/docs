# /char

## Syntax

**/char**

## Description

Extends EverQuest's `/charinfo` to display character bind points. The alias `/char` must be used if you want MacroQuest's information included. 

## Note

Uses _Y, X, Z_ location to match the convention used by EQ (Rather than _X, Y, Z_ used by the rest of the world and MQ internally).
