### Notes

Filters added through `/filter` are excluded from EverQuest's logging (`/log`) system.

**Important:** Overly broad filters may capture unintended messages. For example, filtering out `A rat` will also hide messages containing that exact phrase, such as /con messages.

## Examples

```text
/filter name add Joe         This will add a filter that ignores all lines that start with "Joe"
/filter name add *Joe        This will add a filter that ignores all lines that have "Joe" anywhere in them
```
